## Issues and other information

One issue I had with my HTML validator was this error below.
![HTML Validator error](./docs/html-validator-known-issue.JPG)
I am aware of this issue, however, I decided not to change the HTML Semantic as I believe this portion of the HTML/CSS was vitally important for my site's responsiveness, as this error relates to the hamburger menu. As I decided not to use Bootstrap or Javascript, this was the only way to accomplish it.
