## Known issues and other information

One issue when I ran my pages through the HTML validator was this error below.
![HTML Validator error](./docs/html-validator-known-issue.JPG)

I am fully aware of this issue and I decided not to fix the error as it related to the vital responsive hamburger menu on my site.

Normally I would have fixed this error if it was a client's website or any other website. I would have used Javascript or bootstrap to create the hamburger menu. 

However, for the assessment requirement, I decided to not change the code, and leave the error as it was the only way I knew how to create the responsive hamburger menu using just CSS.
